3-Ingredient Pancakes
These single-serving pancakes are a bit more like the custardy center bite of French toast: fluffy, eggy, and golden delicious.

Yield:
Serves 1 (serving size: 3 pancakes)

Ingredients
1 medium ripe banana
2 tablespoons whole-wheat flour
1 large egg, lightly beaten

Preparation
1. Mash banana with a fork until smooth. Add flour and egg; stir well with a whisk.

2. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Spoon batter onto skillet, using one-third of batter for each pancake. 
Cook 2 minutes or until tops are covered with bubbles and edges look cooked. Carefully turn pancakes over; cook 1 to 2 minutes or until bottoms are lightly browned.
